      <h2>Aims and Scopes</h2>
      <p class="body">Avestia Publishing has initiated the publication of the Journal of Biomass to Biofuel (JBB).</p>

      <p class="body">This journal is based on the continuous model in English and adopts the open-access model, meaning all interested audience have free access to the journal's homepage and articles with no need for subscription. This ensures larger audience and therefore higher citations.</p>

      <p class="body">Users are allowed to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of the articles in this journal without asking prior permission from the publisher or the author. This is in accordance with the BOAI definition of open access.</p>

      <p class="body">All published papers of JBB will be submitted to Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search, Open J-Gate, Mendeley, and Genomics JournalSeek for indexing.</p>

      <p class="body">JBB welcomes research and review papers related to Biomass and Biofuel including but not limited to the areas of:</p>

      <ul class="topics">
        <li>Algal Biofuels </li>
        <li>Aviation Biofuel </li>
        <li>Bioalcohols (Bioethanol, Biobutanol, etc) </li>
        <li>Biodiesel (Different Generations) </li>
        <li>Bioethers (e.g. Octane Rating Enhancers)</li> 
        <li>Biogas (Biomethane and Biohydrogen)</li> 
        <li>Biomass Characterization Related to Biological Conversions </li>
        <li>Biomass Recalcitrance to Biological Conversions </li>
        <li>Bio-oil (e.g. By Pyrolysis) </li>
        <li>Biorefinery Industries </li>
        <li>Energy Production by Biomass Incineration </li>
        <li>Pretreatment of Lignocelluloses for Biofuel Production </li>
        <li>Syngas</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="body">All aspect and domains of application including:<br>
      fermentation; biochemical engineering; bioreactor engineering; enzymatic conversions; life-cycle assessment; downstream processing; modeling, simulation, and techno-economical evaluations are covered.</p>

      <h2>Propose a Special Topic</h2>
      <p class="body">Researchers interested in editing/co-editing special topics are encouraged to send a written proposal to: <a href="mailto:jbb@avestia.com" class="body-link">jbb@avestia.com</a>.</p>

      <p class="body">The proposal should contain the full names and affiliations of the editors, their research background and academic CV, and a detailed description regarding the special topic including:</p>
