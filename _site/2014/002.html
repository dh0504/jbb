<p align="justify"><i><strong>Abstract- </strong>In this study, rice straw was pretreated by an ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][OAc]), prior to enzymatic hydrolysis and ethanol production. The pretreatment was carried out at 120 °C for 5 h under atmospheric pressure. Afterward, saccharification was conducted at 45 °C for 72 h using 20 FPU cellulase and 30 IU β-glucosidase per gram of cellulose. Glucose yield was significantly increased from 25.7% for the untreated straw to over 75% for the treated straw. Moreover, the ethanol yield by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation was improved from 35.6% for the untreated straw to 79.7% for the treated straw. SEM images showed more open and accessible structure for the treated straw compared to the untreated one which assisted the penetration of hydrolytic enzymes in the saccharification and fermentation. From FTIR analysis, it was suggested that the crystallinity reduction and conversion of cellulose I to II are the main changes in the straw as a result of the pretreatment.</i></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Recently, lignocellulosic
biomasses attract great attention of scientists as a potential feedstock for
bioethanol production. Lignocelluloses are widely available in different waste
sources such as municipal, agricultural, and forestry residues, and they mainly
consist of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin [1]. Cellulose and
hemicellulose can be both enzymatically or chemically hydrolyzed to reduced
sugar units and further fermented to ethanol. However, complex structure,
lignin strong linkage, hydrogen bonds between cellulose chains, and highly
crystalline cellulose structure cause these materials to be very resistance to
both chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis [1-3]. Therefore, for economically
feasible ethanol production, an effective pretreatment step should be applied
to improve the saccharification yield. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> By now, various chemical,
physical, biological, and combined pretreatment methods have been employed. The
most common methods are alkali or acid pretreatments [4, 5], ammonia fiber
explosion [6], steam or carbon dioxide explosion [7, 8], and liquid hot water
pretreatment [9]. However, majority of these methods need high temperatures and
pressures or harsh acidic or basic conditions. Therefore, they are not
environmentally friendly and require high amount of energy [10]. Recently, to
overcome these drawbacks, researchers have attempted to use a new class of
cellulose solvents called ionic liquids. Ionic liquids are organic salts that are
liquid at room temperature [11]. These materials have some priorities over the
conventional solvents including being more environmentally benign, requiring
less process time, and being more efficient [12].In addition, the processing
conditions of ionic liquids are mild, and their recycling efficiency is over
99% [10]. Cellulose regenerated by ionic liquids is less crystalline and more
amenable to enzymatic hydrolysis [13].</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The various ionic liquids, 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium
chloride ([BMIM]Cl), 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydroxide ([EMIM]OH), and
-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][OAc]) have superior cellulose
solubility characteristic. However, the ionic liquids involving Cl<sup>-</sup>
and OH<sup>-</sup>are corrosive and can adversely affect the enzymes activity
resulting in lower overall hydrolysis yield. [EMIM]][OAc] is among the best
cellulose solvents in terms of solubility characterization and compatibility
with hydrolytic enzymes. Furthermore, it is an environmentally friendly ionic
liquid [14]. Because of these attractive properties, it has been suggested as
an effective chemical for lignocelluloses pretreatment to improve hydrolysis
and ethanol production [15, 16].</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Rice straw is one of the most
available lignocelluloses residues in all over the world. Several previous
studies have attempted to improve its digestibility to reduced sugar units
applying different pretreatment methods such as microwave pretreatment [17,
18], electron beam irradiation [19], and dilute acid hydrolysis [20]. In a
recent study, Feng [21] used an ionic solvent, [AMIM]Cl, to treat the straw at
110 ºC. He succeeded to improve the hydrolysis yield from 23.7% for the
untreated straw to 53.3% for the pretreated one. However, to our knowledge, no
previous work has been done on pretreatment of rice straw by [EMIM][OAc].</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The main goal of this study is to enhance bioethanol
production of rice straw by applying [EMIM][OAc] pretreatment. Enzymatic
hydrolysis and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation were performed to
evaluate the pretreatment effect. The compositional and structural properties
of the pretreated straw were also studied by different analyses.</p>






<h2> 2. Materials and Methods </h2>

<h4> 2.1. Materials and Microorganism </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The rice straw used in this
study was obtained from Lenjan field (Isfahan, Iran). Before experiments, its
size was reduced from about 50 mm to less than 0.853 mm (mesh 20) and then
dried at 40 ºC for 24 h. The solid content of straw was measured after drying
at 105 ºC until a constant weight was achieved.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A commercially available ionic
liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][OAc]), was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich provided by BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany).</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A fluctuation of <i>Saccharomyces
cerevisiae</i> (CCUG 53310, Culture Collection of University of Gothenburg,
Sweden) was used as a fermenting microorganism. The microorganism maintenance
and its biomass production was conducted according to the method presented by
Karimi et al. [22]. </p>

<h4> 2.2. Pretreatment Procedure </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A suspension of rice straw in
the ionic liquid with 5% solid loading were prepared in a 200 ml beaker in an
oil bath at 120 ºC and pretreated for 5 h. The pretreatment conditions were
selected based on optimized parameters obtained in a previous research [23].The
suspension was mixed every 15 min by a glass rode to ensure complete
distribution of solid in the solvent. At the end of the pretreatment, the
dissolved solid was regenerated by sudden addition of 30 ml boiling water. The
precipitated solid was recovered by vacuum filtration and washed by ethanol and
boiling water till clear filtrate was achieved. The straw was then dried at
40ºC for three days, and then stored in sealed bags for further use and
analysis.</p>

<h4> 2.3. Enzymatic HydrolysisAME </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Cellulase (Celluclast 1.5L,
Novozyme, Denmark) and &#946;-glucosidase (Novozyme 188, Novozyme, Denmark)
enzymes were used for the hydrolysis. The activity of cellulase was 60 FPU/ml
(measured according to Adney and Baker (1996) procedure and that of
&#946;-glucosidase was 190 IU/ml (measured by the method presented by Ximenes et
al. [24]1996).</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Enzymatic hydrolysis of all
treated and untreated straws was carried out in 100 ml bottles containing 30 ml
media of 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.8) and 10 g/l substrate loading.
Then 20 FPU cellulase and 30 IU &#946;-glucosidase per gram of substrate and
0.5 g/l sodium azide were added to each bottle. The hydrolysis was conducted in
a shaker incubator with the speed of 100 rpm at 45 ºC for 72 h. Liquid samples
were periodically taken and analyzed for the released sugar.</p>

<h4> 2.4. Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A fluctuation of <i>Saccharomyces
cerevisiae</i> (CCUG 53310, Culture Collection of University of Gothenburg,
Sweden) was used as a fermenting microorganism. The treated and untreated
straws were subjected to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation at 38
°C under anaerobic conditions for 48 h in a shaker incubator at 80 rpm. A media
containing 5 g/l yeast extract, 7.5 g/l (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,
3.5 g/l K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.75 g/l MgSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O,
1 g/l CaCl<sub>2</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O, and 50 g/l pretreated or untreated rice
straw was prepared in 0.05 M buffer citrate (pH 5). After sterilization at 121
ºC for 20 min and cooling to room temperature, 1 g/l <i>S. cerevisiae </i>and
20 FPU cellulase and 30 IU &#946;-glucosidase per gram of substrate were added
to the mixture and incubated for 48 h. Liquid samples were taken, centrifuged,
and analyzed for metabolite and sugar analyses.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The theoretical yield of ethanol
production was calculated based on the glucose that can be produced supposedly
from the glucan in the treated or non-treated rice straw while the glycerol
yield was reported as milligrams of produced glycerol per gram of the
theoretical glucose [22].</p>

<h4> 2.5. Analytical Methods </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Ethanol and glycerol contents in
the liquid samples obtained by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation
as well as various sugar contents (glucose, xylose, arabinose, mannose, and
galactose) were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
equipped with UV/vis and RI detectors (Jasco International Co., Tokyo, Japan).
Ethanol and glycerol were analyzed on an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad,
Richmond, CA, USA) at 60 °C with 0.6 ml/min 5 mM sulfuric acid as an eluent. In
addition, sugars were analyzed on an ion-exchange Aminex HPX-87P column
(Bio-Rad, USA) at 85 °C with deionized water as a mobile phase with the flow
rate of 0.6 ml/min.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> To analyze carbohydrate and
lignin contents of the biomass, an standard method presented by National
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) was employed [25]. The carbohydrates were
hydrolyzed to the corresponding sugars and analyzed by HPLC. Lignin was
classified into acid-insoluble and soluble materials. The acid-soluble lignin
was measured by UV–vis spectroscopy at 240 nm with absorptivity of 25 l/g.cm.
The acid-insoluble part was determined as a part of solid collected by
filtration after the hydrolysis.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">FTIR reflectance spectra of
untreated and treated straws were collected within wave numbers of 600 to 4,000
cm<sup>-1 </sup>with 4 cm<sup>-1 </sup>resolution using a Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR). The spectrometer was equipped with a universal ATR (Attenuated Total
Reflection) accessory and Deuteratedtriglycine sulfate (DTGS) detector (Bruker
Tensor 27 FT-IR). Their spectra were obtained with an average of 60 scans.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of untreated and treated straws were obtained to analyze
morphological effect of the pretreatment step. Dried treated and untreated
straw were coated with gold (BAL-TEC SCD 005) and analyzed by SEM (PHILIPS,
XL30) at 15 kV. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">All experiments were done at
least in duplicate and the reported results are the average of obtained values.
The error bars on reported figures are the range of higher and lower values
obtained for each point showing the range of validity of the results. </p>





<h2> 3. Results and Discussion </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Rice straw, one of the most
abundant lignocellulosic wastes, was subjected to a solvent pretreatment using
[EMIM][OAc] at its optimum treatment conditions which is 120 °C for 5 h
[26-28].</p>

<h4> 3.1. Enzymatic Hydrolysis </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> In order to examine the effect
of pretreatment on rice straw saccharification, enzymatic hydrolysis of all
treated and untreated straw was done for 72 h at 45 ºC using cellulase and
&#946;-glucosidase enzymes. Glucose and xylose yields of hydrolysis of the
treated straw were significantly improved and summarized in Table 1 and Figure
1, respectively.</p>

<figcaption>
Figure 1. Xylose hydrolysis yield for untreated rice straw and the straw treated with
[EMIM][OAc] for 5 h at 120 °C (upper curve for treated straw and the lower for
untreated one).</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The major hydrolysis was
obtained after 24 h hydrolysis, and prolongation of the hydrolysis to 72 h
showed a minor improvement (Table 1). Xylose is another product of hydrolysis
comes from hemicelluloses hydrolysis. The pretreatment significantly improved
the yield of xylan hydrolysis (Figure 1). According to obtained data,
hydrolysis rate at the first 24 h was significantly higher for treated straw
compared to the untreated one. Moreover, the same trend was observed after 72 h
hydrolysis. These results confirm the possibility of the claim that ionic
pretreatment step can efficiently improve the straw digestibility in the
hydrolysis step.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The results are in line of the
results obtained by Shafiei et al. [29] on pretreatment of spruce wood powder
by the same ionic liquid. They showed that prolongation of the pretreatment
time from 3 h to 15 h did not positively affect the yield of hydrolysis.
Furthermore, it was shown that using the pretreatment at high temperature of
120 °C is more effective than the pretreatment with [EMIM][OAc] at lower
temperature even for a very long time (i.e., at 90 ºC for 24 or 70 h) [16].</p>

<h4> 3.2. Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Ethanol was produced by SSF at
38 ºC for 48 h in the presence of cellulase, &#946;-glucosidase, and <i>S.
cerevisiae </i>for the untreated and pretreated straw and results are reported
in Table 1. As it can be noticed from the data, the ethanol yield was improved
from 35% to 79% which indicates the great impacts of the pretreatment. The
results of rice straw pretreatment by [EMIM][OAc]are comparable with the
results of wheat straw pretreated by [EMIM]DEP [13], a similar ionic liquid
with different anionic group. The observed results could be predicted from the
fact that the opened up structure and more accessible substrate to the
hydrolytic enzymes can have a dramatic positive effect on the digestibility of
cellulose which followed by more efficient conversion to the final product.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Glycerol is the major byproduct
of ethanol production, and its production improvement by the pretreatment is
compatible with the ethanol yield enhancement. Glycerol yield was improved from
57.3 mg/g for untreated straw to 110.3 mg/g of glucose for treated one which
shows about 100% improvement. </p>

<h4> 3.3. Compositional Analysis </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">To investigate and justify the origin
of the observed improvement, the structural composition of treated and
untreated straw, supposed to have the most significant importance on
hydrolysis, was determined, and the results are shown in Figure 2. As it can be
concluded from the results, glucan content of the regenerated solid was
increased compared with that of untreated straw which indicates more purified
cellulose resulted in more efficient hydrolysis of the pretreated solid. On the
other hand, xylan, resulted from the hydrolysis of hemicelluloses, was reduced
by the pretreatment. Moreover, lignin, the most important obstacle for
enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials, was reduced in precipitated
solid in comparison with the untreated straw. Lignin and hemicelluloses are
both responsible for recalcitrance of lignocelluloses which were decreased due
to solubilization in the ionic liquid and not precipitation during regeneration
(addition of the anti-solvent). The hemicellulose and lignin removal leads to a
higher concentration and more accessible cellulose, which improved the yield of
hydrolysis and ethanol production. There is also a minor change in ash content
of the straw as a result of the pretreatment.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">As discussed in the hydrolysis
result section, it could be predicted that increasing pretreatment retention
time at high temperature (more than 100 ºC) may cause some degradation effect
on cellulose and hemicelluloses; however, cellulose percent is still increased.
The degradation of glucan and xylan at 130 ºC was proved by Lee et al. [16]. In
addition, the lignin removal effect of ionic liquid treatment was also observed
by several previous studies [16, 30-32].</p>

<h4> 3.4. Change in the Morphology of Rice Straw by Pretreatment </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Morphology of the pretreated and
untreated straw was analyzed by SEM images (Figure 3). One of the main
obstacles, or maybe the most effective one, for the digestibility of straw is
crystalline and organized structure of the cellulosic fibers. As could be seen
in SEM images, the organized structure of the straw is completely destroyed as
a result of the pretreatment. Therefore, the structure of the straw was changed
from a compact and unavailable form to an open up and widely accessible form.
This could assist and accelerate the penetration of the enzymes to the
carbohydrates. Also, there are some fine spots on the untreated straw which
disappear on the treated one. These spots are silica which is one of the
problematic component of rice straw in both its storage and conversion. Removal
of this component as a result of the pretreatment is another possible reason
for improvement of enzymatic hydrolysis.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">To evaluate the pretreatment
effect on cellulose crystallinity of straw, FTIR analysis of the treated and
untreated straw was conducted. FTIR spectra and absorbance data are presented
in Figure 4 and Table 2, respectively.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The absorption bands at 1430 cm<sup>-1
</sup>represents crystalline cellulose I, while the band at 898 cm<sup>-1 </sup>is
assigned to the cellulose II and amorphous cellulose which is more amenable to
enzymatic hydrolysis [33]. The results showed that cellulose I in the native
straw was changed to cellulose II as a result of the pretreatment. Furthermore,
the absorption ratio at absorption bands of 1430 and 896 cm<sup>-1</sup>,
referred to as crystallinity index (CI) [33], was used for evaluation of
crystallinity reduction due to the pretreatment. This value for untreated straw
and treated straw was 0.47 and 0.38, respectively. Moreover, another index for
crystallinity evaluation is total crystallinity index (TCI), the ratio of
absorption bands at 1975 and 2918 cm<sup>-1</sup>, was obtained to be 1.6 and
1.5 for the untreated and treated straws, respectively. As indicated by both CI
and TCI calculations, majority of crystalline cellulose was modified to
amorphous and less crystalline regions which are amenable to enzymatic attack.</p>

<h4> 3.5. Mass Balance </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Overall mass balance for
pretreatment, hydrolysis, and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation
step was presented in Table 3. As stated by the observed data, each ton of
pretreated rice straw can produce 450 kg glucose and 250 L ethanol. However,
these values for untreated straw are only 120 kg and 100 L, respectively.
Reported by FAO, the worldwide rice production in 2012 was 724.5 million tons.
On average, 1-1.5 kg straw is produced per kg of rice [34] which results in production
of 900 million tons rice straw annually. According to the results of current
study, this amount of straw has a potential to produce 225 billion liters
ethanol per year.</p>

<h2> 4. Conclusions </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Pretreatment of rice straw using
ionic liquid [EMIM][OAc] can be considered as a promising alternative to
improve the enzymatic digestibility and ethanol production. Pretreatment of
rice straw at 120 ºC for 5 h can improve the yield of ethanol production by 75
%. More accessible morphology, less crystallinity, lower lignin and
hemicelluloses concentrations are the main reasons for the improvements.</p>
